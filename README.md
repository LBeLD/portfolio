# Portfolio Page

Portfolio page coded with React, Bootstrap 4, Sass and Gulp.


## History
Responsive and with clean design, this page is the first step for my goal of landing a Web Developer job.
Coded with React and Bootstrap 4, this page shows some of my projects during my learning process. 
Itâ€™s also a demonstration of my coding skills to future employers.
